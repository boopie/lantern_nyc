				<h3> At Lantern NYC, we commit our energy, passion, and time to giving others a hand-up rather than a hand-out. Our mission is to break the cycle of poverty and be a source of hope by connecting resources to vulnerable communities, providing tools necessary for self-sustainability, and building meaningful relationships with our neighbors, near and far. </h3>
